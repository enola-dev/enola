# The project view file (.bazelproject) is used to import targets into IDEs.
# See https://ij.bazel.build/docs/project-views.html for IntelliJ.
# See https://github.com/salesforce/bazel-eclipse/blob/main/docs/common/projectviews.md for VS Code
# (with https://github.com/salesforce/bazel-vscode-java).

# tools/eclipse/.managed-defaults.bazelproject has Eclipse (and thus VSC) specific settings which IntelliJ doesn't dig.
