/**
 * Singleton.
 *
 * <p>Singletons statically hold a value for the lifetime of the JVM.
 *
 * <p>This is great for "global" services; some initialization code called at the start of an
 * application sets its value, which can then be easily looked up from anywhere in an application.
 * It is not possible to later change or reset that value - this is an intentional design decision.
 *
 * <p>The problem with that is that this is not very suitable for tests, where there typically is
 * not a clear single entry point. That's why this is integrated with {@link TLC}, and returns an
 * instance of its type pushed on the Context - if there is one.
 *
 * <p>See also SingleTest for how to use this. TODO Provide 2 inline code examples (main() + Test).
