/**
 * MultipartResources are "logical" resources which do have an URI, but are composed of multiple
 * "parts" which are independent (sub)resources, each with their own {@link MediaType} and content.
 *
 * <p>Examples could be Emails with attachments (RFC 2045 & 2046), or files on operating systems
 * with file systems where a single file can contain multiple alternative data streams (e.g. NTFS,
 * and old classic Mac OS's HFS with data & resources forks), or things like the {@link
 * FrontmatterResource}.
 *
 * <p>The URI of the sub-resources should correspond to the "parent" MultipartResource's URI
 * appended by the part name as a #fragment.
 *
 * <p>This interface intentionally does not extend {@link Resource}, because not all implementations
 * will have a "root" resource (although some may).
