    //   to see any such (not so) "secret" environment variables!
    //
    // Similarly, an implementation which uses System.getProperty() is also not such a great idea,
    //   really only marginally better than using System.getenv(). That's because the "java -D"
    //   launch parameters are often still too broadly visible.
    //
    // Lastly, a FileSecretManager which stores the secrets in an encrypted file vault which is
    //   decrypted with a passphrase which the user must type when starting an application is a
    //   possibility.  We, however, prefer focusing on implementations based on OS support.
