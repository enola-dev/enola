/**
 * KnownDocsProvider offers, if available, a "better URL" to use as link target in generated HTML or
 * Markdown etc. documentation for some known IRIs. For example:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>https://docs.enola.dev/models/enola.dev/emoji/ instead of https://enola.dev/emoji (from the
 *       early days, before the HTTP redirector on enola.dev was set up)
 *   <li>https://docs.enola.dev/models/www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns/type/ instead of
 *       http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type (for which we cannot set up any HTTP
 *       redirector; and which is nicer to read than e.g. https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_type)
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The KnownMetadataProvider (TBD) is related to this, but has a different purpose.
