# GEXF Java API

The classes in this directory are a Java API for the
[Graph Exchange XML Format](https://gexf.net) (GEXF).

These were generated using `xjc` from JAXB RI Tools like this:

    xjc ???

## How to get `xjc`

    git clone https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaxb-ri.git && cd jaxb-ri/jaxb-ri
    git checkout 4.0.5-RI
    mvn package

    ???

## ToDo

1. Add link to this on https://github.com/francesco-ficarola/gexf4j/tree/master (which is for GEXF 1.2 whereas we want 1.3)
