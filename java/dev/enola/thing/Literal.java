/**
 * Literal is a value with datatype (IRI) which can appear in the {@link Thing#properties()} Map
 * values.
 *
 * <p>Normally, values are some other native Java object; this is only for cases which could not be
 * decoded to a more suitable Java type, because no {@link Datatype} for this literal's datatype IRI
 * was registered.
 *
 * <p>This is a LEGACY type which (now) overlaps with {@link Thing#datatype(String predicateIRI)}
 * (and a String value property). Prefer using that than this, which will eventually be removed.
