/**
 * IRI (Internationalized Resource Identifier) at its core is basically just any object which can be
 * identified by a typically globally (or "clearly within a specific context") unique String; see
 * also {@link ID}.
 *
 * <p>Contrary to {@link URL} this is technically not per-se limited to "something which can be
 * fetched". It has no explicit notion of a "protocol" (scheme) or "authority" (host) - nor path.
 * Thus, there is also no resolve() kind of method here (use {@link URI} or {@link URL} if that's
 * needed). There is therefore also no normalize() sort of method here - because that again really
 * depends on the "protocol" (scheme).
 *
 * <p>The "internationalized" aspect here specifically refers to the fact that what {@link
 * #toString()} returns is not "encoded" in any way; it's literally just some String, which may well
 * contain "rich" (Unicode) characters (although implementations may well limit and not permit e.g.
 * whitespace, etc.) Implementing classes may however well choose to offer additional encoding
 * related methods.
