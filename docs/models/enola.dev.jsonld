THIS FILE WILL BE OVERWRITTEN WITH THE GENERATED

It's useful to have it (force added, because .gitgignore)
in Git so that e.g. tools/docs/serve-quick.bash "just works".

You can run

$ git update-index --assume-unchanged docs/models/enola.dev.jsonld

to hide changes to this file from commands like "git status".
