# Kubernetes Edition

Enola 🕵🏾‍♀️ [Kubernetes](https://github.com/vorburger/LearningKubernetes-CodeLabs) Edition
adds support for the [Kubernetes Resource Model](https://github.com/vorburger/LearningKubernetes-CodeLabs/blob/develop/docs/krm.md) (KRM)
to [Enola Core](../core.md).

Here's how to use it, assuming you have [access to an installed Kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/vorburger/LearningKubernetes-CodeLabs/blob/develop/docs/install.md) and have [the `kubectl` CLI](https://github.com/vorburger/LearningKubernetes-CodeLabs/blob/develop/docs/fun/kubecli.md) working locally (with a valid `~/.kube/config`).

First, [download an Enola Release](https://github.com/vorburger/enola/releases) and unpack and install it.

Now try the following:

_TODO Run the dogfooding [demo.md](demo.md) executable Playbook, and insert it here, with its captured output!_
