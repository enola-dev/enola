# April 2024 (2024-02-17)

Saluton,

I've been reading up more about Linked Data & RDF etc. and started to evolve Enola into that direction.

The new [internal implementation doc](../../dev/implementation.md) keeps my help my sanity about what's where in the Enola code.

The new `--load` CLI option can now read Turtle üê¢ `.ttl` files, so you can do e.g. `./enola get --load file:test/picasso.ttl http://example.enola.dev/Picasso` and get TODO.

<!-- TODO Link to /use/ doc with example about how to do this - or perhaps simply point to models/build.bash -->

But more interestingly, you can generate Markdown, Mermaid and Graphviz from such Models of Things.

<!-- TODO Link to https://docs.enola.dev/models/ once it's live, saying ' .... "dog fooding" üê∂ ..." -->

Best,

M.
