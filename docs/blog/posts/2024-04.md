# April 2024

Saluton,

[Linked Data & RDF](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html) etc. is great - I've been reading up more about  etc. and started to evolve Enola into that direction.

[Greeting Tutorial](../../models/example.org/greeting.md) illustrates how the new `--load` CLI option can read 🐢 Turtle (`*.ttl`) files, and how `docgen` now digs that.

[😃 Emoji](../../models/enola.dev/emoji.md) is one of the first _Models_ - these now are automatically
generated (and [other 🐶 Models](../../models/index.md)).

[This internal implementation doc](../../dev/implementation.md) helps me keep my sanity about what's where in the Enola code.

Best,

M.
