# April 2024

Saluton,

[Linked Data & RDF](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html) etc. is great - I've been reading up more about  etc. and started to evolve Enola into that direction.

The new `--load` CLI option can now read 🐢 Turtle (`*.ttl`) files, so you can do e.g. `./enola get --load file:test/picasso.ttl http://example.enola.dev/Picasso` and get TODO.

<!-- TODO Link to /use/ doc with example about how to do this - or perhaps simply point to models/build.bash -->

[😃 Emoji](https://docs.enola.dev/models/enola.dev/emoji/) is one of the first _Models,_ these now are automatically
generated (and [other 🐶 Models](../../models/index.md)).

[This internal implementation doc](../../dev/implementation.md) helps me keep my sanity about what's where in the Enola code.

Best,

M.
