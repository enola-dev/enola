# Git Repo Created (2023-03-17)

Hello, world.

The <https://github.com/enola-dev/enola> repo was just created.

We're at 111 commits at [0f2da74](https://github.com/enola-dev/enola/tree/0f2da74caab337a8273e992d288c0e48c2884c76), most of which is basic build infrastructure, some initial docs (which will evolve), and a very early outline of The Core's model and metamodel (which will still significantly change).

I had great conversations about Enola with 2 old friends during the breaks of the Voxxed Days conference today!

Tx,

M.
