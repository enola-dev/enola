# Generate üèóÔ∏è

Generates [various outputs](../help/index.md#gen) from (loaded) _Things._

Many of these formats "mirror" the [respective support in Rosetta](../rosetta/index.md).
The difference is that Rosetta transforms one resource into another one,
whereas this generates (possibly several) output/s from possibly several input/s.

## Sigma (TODO)

We have plans to support https://www.sigmajs.org.

## Graphviz

Based on [Rosetta's Graphviz support](../rosetta/index.md#graphviz):

```bash cd ../.././..
$ ./enola gen graphviz --no-file-loader --load=enola:TikaMediaTypes --output /tmp/
...
```

Produces a (rather huge...) `graphviz.gv` which can then be rendered to an (ugly!) SVG e.g. using:

    dot -Ksfdp -Tsvg -O /tmp/graphviz.gv

## GEXF

See [Rosetta's GEXF support](../rosetta/index.md#gexf).

<!--
## Graph Commons (TODO)

See [Rosetta's Graph Commons support](../rosetta/index.md#graph-commons).

    ./enola rosetta --in enola:TikaMediaTypes --out /tmp/TikaMediaTypes.graphcommons.json

## Markdown (TODO)

[The (old) `docgen`](../docgen/index.md) will later be integrated into a (new) generic `gen markdown`.
