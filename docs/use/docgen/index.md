# DocGen

We can generate nice Markdown documentation as seen in [the tutorial](../../models/example.org/class.md)
or for [our example Library model](../library/index.md), including a Graph in either Mermaid.JS or
[Graphwiz](../rosetta/index.md#graphviz) or [GEXF](../rosetta/index.md#gexf) format.

```bash cd ../.././..
$ ./enola docgen --model docs/use/library/model.yaml --diagram=mermaid >docs/use/docgen/docgen.md
...
```

## docgen.md

{% include "./docgen.md" %}
