# DocGen 📃

We can generate nice Markdown documentation as seen in [the tutorial](../../models/example.org/class.md)
or for [our example Library model](../library/index.md), including a Graph in either Mermaid.JS or
[Graphwiz](../rosetta/index.md#graphviz) or [GEXF](../rosetta/index.md#gexf) format, and
[a Timeline](../../models/example.org/timeline.md).

`docgen` (old) will later be integrated into (new) [generic `gen markdown`](../gen/index.md#markdown).
