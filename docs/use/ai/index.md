# AI ðŸ”® Command

The `ai` command [works with Agents](../../tutorial/chat.md) with input from the CLI:

    $ ./enola ai --llm=echo:/ --in="hello, world"
    hello, world

    $ ./enola ai --llm="google://?model=gemini-2.5-flash-lite" --in="hello, world"
    Hello, world! How can I help you today?

**TODO** _Document how [this also (already) supports](../../tutorial/agents.md) `--agents`..._
