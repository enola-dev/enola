# Logging üêû

Enola "out of the box" is "silent", and does not "print what it's doing".

But the _verbosity_ command-line argument allows to "see what's going on internally":

* `-v` will show only _"error"_ (AKA _"severe")_ log messages
* `-vv` will additionally also show _"warning"_ log messages
* `-vvv` will additionally also show _"information"_ log messages
* `-vvvv` will additionally also show _"debug"_ (AKA _"debug"_ and _"fine")_ log messages
* `-vvvvv` will additionally also show _"more debug"_ (AKA _"finer")_ log messages
* `-vvvvvv` will additionally also show _"trace"_ (AKA _"finest")_ log messages
* `-vvvvvvv` will show all available log messages

The [Chat UI Server](../server/index.md#chat) also has a UI which shows which Agents & Tools were called.
