# Fetch

`fetch` fetches a _Resource_ from an _URL_ and outputs its content. You can therefore use this similarly to [curl](https://curl.se/) or [httpie](https://httpie.io/cli) or [wget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wget). (If you want to see the _Media Type,_ use [`info detect`](../info/index.md#detect).)

This is different from [`get`](../get/index.md), which shows _Things_ given an _IRI.
(However the `--load` option of `get` internally does a `fetch`, and supports the same schemes.)

Enola supports the [URI schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_URI_schemes) which are documented below.
These are supported everywhere; including in `fetch`, `--load`, and elsewhere.

## Schemes

### HTTP

This will fetch <https://www.vorburger.ch/hello.md>: _(Note how for security reasons we have to explicitly permit it.)_

```bash cd ../.././..
$ ./enola fetch --http-scheme https://www.vorburger.ch/hello.md
...
```

Enola locally caches HTTP responses on the filesystem.

### Files

We can do `cat`-like equivalent of local files using [the `file:` scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_URI_scheme):

```bash cd ../.././..
$ echo "hello" >/tmp/hi.txt && ./enola fetch file:///tmp/hi.txt
...
```

We can omit the `file:` scheme and use absolute or relative paths,
because (in the CLI) the current working directory is implicitly [the _base URI_
used to resolve URI references](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier#URI_references):

```bash cd ../.././..
$ ./enola fetch /tmp/hi.txt
...
```

### Classpath

```bash cd ../.././..
$ ./enola fetch classpath:/VERSION
...
```

### Data

Enola [supports (RFC 2397) `data:` URLs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme):

```bash cd ../.././..
$ ./enola fetch "data:application/json;charset=UTF-8,%7B%22key%22%3A+%22value%22%7D"
...
```

### Empty

`empty:` is a (non-standard) URL scheme in Enola for "no content" (as an alternative to `data:,`):

```bash cd ../.././..
$ ./enola fetch empty:/
...
```

### Exec (TODO)

We plan to support an `exec:` scheme,  whose content will be the resulting of running the given command,
similar to e.g. [üê™ Camel's](https://camel.apache.org/components/4.8.x/exec-component.html) or (vaguely) Web Browsers'
`javascript:`.

<!-- TODO ### Git `git:` ? -->

## Parameters

Enola considers certain generic query parameters in URLs it fetches.

These work with most but not all schemes (e.g. `data:` does not permit query parameters).

### Media Type

Adding e.g. `?mediaType=application/json` [overrides the Media Type](../info/index.md#detect)
which e.g. a server provided in e.g. a HTTP header,
or that was determined from a file extension.

### Charset

Adding e.g. `?charset=iso-8859-1` overrides (and takes precedence over)
the Charset from the Media Type (if any) or any HTTP header like mechanisms.

### Integrity (TODO)

We plan
to support `?integrity=...`
to verify resource integrity via a [cryptographic digest ("hash")])(https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/hashing/)
using a [Multiformats's Multibase encoded Multihash](https://www.multiformats.io).
This is similar e.g. to [HTML's Subresource Integrity (SRI)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity).
