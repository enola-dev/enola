# Fetch ‚§µÔ∏è

`fetch` fetches a _Resource_ from an
_URL_ and outputs its content. You can therefore use this similarly to [curl](https://curl.se/) or [httpie](https://httpie.io/cli) or [wget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wget). (If you want to see the
_Media Type,_ use [`info detect`](../info/index.md#detect).)

This is different from [`get`](../get/index.md), which shows _Thing/s_ given an _IRI.
(However the `--load` option of `get` internally does a `fetch`, and supports the same schemes.)

Enola supports the [URI schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_URI_schemes) which are documented below.
These are supported everywhere; including in `fetch`, `--load`, and elsewhere.

## Schemes

### Files

We can do `cat`-like equivalent of local files using [the
`file:` scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_URI_scheme):

```bash cd ../.././..
$ echo "hello, world" >/tmp/hi.txt && ./enola fetch file:///tmp/hi.txt
...
```

We can omit the `file:` scheme and use absolute or relative paths,
because (in the CLI) the current working directory is implicitly [the _base URI_
used to resolve URI references](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier#URI_references):

```bash cd ../.././..
$ ./enola fetch /tmp/hi.txt
...
```

When running a remotely accessible [server](../server/index.md), you'll most probably want to disable the
`file:` scheme,
to block access to local files for security:

```bash $? cd ../.././..
$ ./enola fetch --no-file-scheme /tmp/hi.txt
...
```

### HTTP

This will fetch <https://www.vorburger.ch/hello.md>: _(Note how for security reasons we have to explicitly permit it.)_

```bash cd ../.././..
$ ./enola fetch --http-scheme https://www.vorburger.ch/hello.md
...
```

Enola locally caches HTTP responses on the filesystem.

### IPFS

Enola, like e.g. [`curl`](https://curl.se), has a _"native protocol handler"_
to [support `ipfs:` URLs for decentralized content from IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/):

```bash cd ../.././..
$ ./enola fetch --ipfs-gateway=https://dweb.link/ipfs/ ipfs://QmXV7pL1CB7A8Tzk7jP2XE9kRyk8HZd145KDptdxzmNLfu
...
```

The `--ipfs-gateway` is the URL of an [IPFS HTTP Gateway](https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/http/gateway/).
Instead of the shown `dweb.link`,
we do (highly) recommend that you [locally install & run](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/) an _IPFS Node,_
such as [IPFS Desktop](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-desktop/),
or [Kubo](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/command-line/),
and then use `--ipfs-gateway=http://localhost:8080/ipfs/` instead.

For initial testing you can specify one of the [public IPFS Gateways](https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/)
(or "rent" one from a provider such as [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/dedicated-ipfs-gateways) or [Infura](https://www.infura.io/product/ipfs) or [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/web3/)).
However, we do **NOT** recommend using these for anything "real",
because of the following disadvantages:

* Local Nodes make great local caches to improve Enola's performance
* Public gateways are likely to rate limit your HTTP requests and return 403 errors
* Enola does not verify the CID hash over the fetched content, so you are implicitly trusting the Gateway (and assume no [MITM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack))
* Running an IPFS Node, especially a permanently on and publicly IP reachable one, furthers the global IPFS network

<!-- PS: IPFS URLs typically don't work directly in your web browser - unless you install the [IPFS Companion Browser Extension](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-companion/).

PPS: Note that the `//` separator after `ipfs:` is mandatory;
we (intentionally) do not support `ipfs:Qm..` (or `ipfs:/Qm..`), nor e.g. `dweb://ipfs/Qm..`.
For background about why this is so,
see https://github.com/ipfs/in-web-browsers/blob/68483d0bbe014d0626ca28b6e0d224341c1e8b8f/ADDRESSING.md and the conclusion of https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/issues/1678#issuecomment-492977659. -->

### Classpath

```bash cd ../.././..
$ ./enola fetch classpath:/VERSION
...
```

### Data

Enola [supports (RFC 2397) `data:` URLs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme):

```bash cd ../.././..
$ ./enola fetch "data:application/json;charset=UTF-8,%7B%22key%22%3A+%22value%22%7D"
...
```

### Multibase

Enola [supports](https://github.com/multiformats/multibase/issues/134)
`multibase:` URLs, which are from [Multiformats](https://multiformats.io/):

```bash cd ../.././..
$ ./enola fetch multibase:maGVsbG8sIHdvcmxk
...
```

Nota bene: This (fetchable) `multibase:` scheme is (intentionally) different from the
`mb:` used for (random) Thing IRIs.

### File Descriptor

`fd:` is a (non-standard) URL scheme in Enola for reading from or writing to [file descriptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor), for:

* `fd:0` [STDIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stdin)
* `fd:1` [STDOUT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stdout)
* `fd:2` [STDERR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stderr)

The _Media Type_ of this special resource will be `application/octet-stream` (**not** `application/binary`),
unless there is [a `?mediaType=` parameter](#media-type).

The _Charset_ will be the default of the JVM,
unless there is (checked first) [a `?charset=` parameter](#charset) (e.g. `fd:0?charset=UTF-16BE`),
or the `?mediaType=` parameter includes a charset (e.g. `fd:1?mediaType=application/yaml;charset=utf-16be`).

<!-- If updating ^^^ then also update JavaDoc of dev.enola.common.io.resource.FileDescriptorResource -->

<!-- TODO Support '-' as special URI shortcut for fd:0 STDIN? -->

### Empty

`empty:` is another (non-standard) URL scheme in Enola for "no content" (as an alternative to `data:,`):

```bash cd ../.././..
$ ./enola fetch empty:/
...
```

### Teapot ü´ñ

We are proud to handle [RFC 2324](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2324.html)-inspired
ü´ñ `coffee:` etc. URLs, in support of [save418.com](https://save418.com/):

```bash cd ../.././..
$ ./enola fetch "kafo://demo.enola.dev/pot-7?#syrup-type=Vanilla"
...
```

All international (¬ß3.) coffee URI schemes are fully supported; and e.g.
`kafo://demo.enola.dev/pot-7?#syrup-type=Vanilla` is valid for sameideanoj. Please note
the following (major and breaking, sorry) backwards incompatibility: Due to what is assumed to
be a typo in the original RFC, for _Catalan, French and Galician_ the correctly accented URI
scheme `caf√©` ("caf%C3%A9") instead of `caf√®` ("caf%C3%E8") is used. However, we
do also support `caf√®` as the _Italian_ URI scheme; this should help to avoid major
systems interoperability disasters. (It may still cause minor language issues; where full
interop with the original RFC spec is required, we recommend using a Locale override URL
parameter; e.g. `caf√®://demo.enola.dev/pot-7?hl=fr`.)

### Exec

TODO We plan to support an `exec:` scheme, whose content will be the resulting of running the given command,
similar to e.g. [üê™ Camel's](https://camel.apache.org/components/4.8.x/exec-component.html) or (vaguely) Web Browsers'
`javascript:`.

<!-- TODO ### Git `git:` ? -->

## Parameters

Enola considers certain generic query parameters in URLs it fetches.

These work with most but not all schemes (e.g. `data:` does not permit query parameters).

### Media Type

Adding e.g. `?mediaType=application/json` [overrides the Media Type](../info/index.md#detect)
which e.g. a server provided in e.g. a HTTP header,
or that was determined from a file extension.

### Charset

Adding e.g. `?charset=iso-8859-1` overrides (and takes precedence over)
the Charset from the Media Type (if any) or any HTTP header like mechanisms.

<!-- ### Locale Adding e.g. `?hl=gsw-CH` overrides the _Locale_ used for textual responses to [Swiss German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_German). -->

### Integrity

Adding
`?integrity=...` verifies resources via a [cryptographic digest ("hash")](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/hashing/)
using a [Multiformats's Multibase encoded Multihash](https://www.multiformats.io).
(This is similar e.g. to [HTML's Subresource Integrity (SRI)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity).)
It works for all schemes:

```bash cd ../.././..
$ ./enola fetch "/tmp/hi.txt?integrity=z8VxiEEn4n7uuGrVQjeoH2KYypytUHttCubqN7rr65xSH3wjLDjHciXuTyTHkoRuJT1Njghj68RQdynADQt9vzLgyEs"
...
```

or:

```bash cd ../.././..
$ ./enola fetch --http-scheme "https://www.vorburger.ch/hello.md?integrity=z8VttgvnrXN5ZzqAh8BLwyup7htUmSM9gbKR445teEECTwMRDQTireiWgWauLiZ4Xr5esrqbVFNbAuAM2XyZ4CTxU7N"
...
```

In order to find the expected Multibase encoded Multihash,
it's simplest to once use a wrong one, and then replace it with the correct one which is shown by the error message:

```bash $? cd ../.././..
$ ./enola fetch --http-scheme "https://www.vorburger.ch/hello.md?integrity=z8VsnXyGnRwJpnrQXB8KcLstvgFYGZ2f5BCm3DVndcNZ8NswtkCqsut69e7yd1FKNtettjgy669GNVt8VSTGxkAiJaB"
...
```

[`enola info digest`](../info/index.md#digest) is an alternative for obtaining the `?integrity=...` value.

Note that while [Multihash](https://www.multiformats.io/multihash/) defines codes for [various hash functions](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/blob/master/table.csv),
Enola (currently) [intentionally](https://github.com/google/guava/issues/5990#issuecomment-2571350434) only actually supports
`sha2-256` & `sha2-512`.

[URL Integrity Spec](../../specs/url-integrity/index.md) describes this further.
