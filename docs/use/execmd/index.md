# Executable Markdown (MD)

_ExecMD_ is a tool ([not a Dr.](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/I%27m_a_doctor,_not_a...)) which executes commands from Markdown code blocks. Inspired by [Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming), this is useful e.g. to create documentation which automatically updates itself to stay in line with current code of tools being documented - such as [later on this page](#cli-options)! ðŸ˜ƒ

## Usage

A code block such as this one in [`demo.md`](../../../docs/use/execmd/demo.md):

```yaml
    ```bash
    $ echo Hi
    WHATEVER IS WRITTEN HERE IS IGNORED
    ```
```

when ran through `./enola execmd docs/use/execmd/index.md` produces:

```bash
$ echo Hi
OVERWRITTEN
```

## MD Format

* Only ` ``` ` fenced code blocks are processed. (Any `~~~` or inline `` ` are ignored.)
* Only `bash` language format code blocks are executed. (Other languages are ignored.)
* The code block must start with `$` which must be followed by the command to run
* As long as lines end with `\` they are appended to the command to run
* All lines after are ignored (and replaced, with CLI option `--inline`)
* The Markdown file may contain several such code blocks

Some flags can be specified in the _preamble_ after ` ```bash`:

* ` ```bash $?` = command is expected to have non-zero exit code
* ` ```bash INIT` = runs `INIT` before the command after the `$` (but "hidden" from MD)

The tool does the following:

* The line is not directly `exec`, but passed as-is to `bash -c`
* The working directory is set to the processed Markdown file's directory (use e.g. ` ```bash cd ..` to change it)
* Command must exit with `0`, otherwise the tool aborts and returns that code (unless ` ```bash $?`)
* Command is killed (times out) after 7s if it "hangs" (useful on CI)
* `STDOUT` & `STDERR` are both captured, and interspersed in MD
* `STDIN` is closed (but you can use `< ...`)
* _TODO_ `TERM` ... ? ðŸ¤”

## Script Extraction

The commands in the MD are also extracted and written into a file named `script` next to the MD. This can be used e.g. to automagically record screencast videos, such as those on other pages of this documentation.

## CLI Options

```bash $? cd .././.././..
$ ./enola execmd --help
...
```

## Noteworthy

Beware of the _"[Fork Bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb)"_ ðŸ˜ˆ which would happen if a Markdown file were to to include an `execmd` command on itself!
