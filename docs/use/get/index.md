# Get Entity

`enola get` will retrieve an _entity_ from its [connectors](../connector/index.md).

## Screencast (Asciinema)

![Demo](script.svg)

## List

Get the list of all available Thing (Template) IRIs, using the special `enola:/` IRI:

```bash cd ../.././..
$ ./enola get --load "models/**.ttl" enola:/
...
```

## Get üê¢

Get something from a loaded üê¢ Turtle resource, e.g. from the [enola.dev/enola.ttl](../../models/enola.dev/enola.ttl) model:

```bash cd ../.././..
$ ./enola get --load models/enola.dev/enola.ttl https://enola.dev/emoji | head --lines=3
...
```

## Get Book

Get a `book` - note how the _related_ `kind` and `library` ID are set, based on the template
[from the model](../library/index.md):

```bash cd ../.././..
$ ./enola get --model docs/use/library/model.yaml demo.book/ABC/0-13-140731-7/1
...
```

Get a `book_kind` - note how the `google` _link_ was set, based on the template
[from the model](../library/index.md):

```bash cd ../.././..
$ ./enola get --model docs/use/library/model.yaml demo.book_kind/0-13-140731-7
...
```

If the entity contains `data` fields, the `Any` protos are displayed correctly "unwrapped".
This can be seen in [the gRPC Demo Connector](../connector/index.md#grpc).
