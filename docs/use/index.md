# Using Enola.dev

The following chapters demonstrate different usage scenarios with recorded demos.

This page documents several options available to locally install and run Enola.

## Binary

Download the [`enola`](../download/latest/enola) binary, then `chmod +x enola`
and launch it directly using `./enola` (on Linux, FreeBSD & macOS); or
`java -jar enola` (e.g. on ðŸªŸ Windows).

## Downloader

[`enola-dl`](../download/latest/enola-dl) downloads the latest version (into
`~/.cache/`) when required, and then directly runs it. If you put this somewhere on
your `$PATH`, e.g. into your `~/bin/`, then you will automagically always be running
the latest up-to-date version of Enola. (We recommend actually saving it renamed as
`enola` instead of `enola-dl`, just for convenience of launching.)

As is currently implemented (using basic `curl`), there is a bit of a start-up time
overhead for this. Future enhancements may further optimize this; e.g. check only
once a day or so.

Of course, whether you are comfortable with such _"Continuous Delivery",_ and thus
_"always living at `HEAD`",_ like in _"rolling release distros",_ or have any concerns
with such an approach e.g. from a security perspective, is entirely your choice - YMMV.

## Container

[`enolac`](../download/latest/enolac) runs Enola from a Container, on Docker (or Podman,
or CRI-O; locally or e.g. on Kubernetes).

It takes the exact same CLI arguments as the "regular" `enola` binary, but pulls it
via a container image, instead of a "local installation", as above.

It appropriately "mounts" the current working directory into the container, so that
relative `file:` URIs should work. Absolute paths on your host won't work, because they
are not accessible to the container ("by design").
