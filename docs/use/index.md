# Using Enola.dev

The project does not yet publish releases.

There are plans to build a server with Web UI later.

For now, use this project by launching the `enola` CLI tool
via a [Developer Set-Up for Local Build](../dev/setup.md),
and then:

    ./enola

which will print usage instructions showing the available subcommands.
