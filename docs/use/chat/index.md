# Chat 💬 (Shell)

Enola’s Chat is _The Shell for the 2030s+_ and the _“last Chat you'll ever need”._

[After installing](../index.md), you can use it like this:

## Screencast

![Demo](script.svg)

## Usage

```bash cd ../.././..
$ HOSTNAME=demo ./enola chat <docs/use/chat/demo.input
...
```

## Exec

Note how the last two "messages" in the example chat above were [`whoami`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoami) and [`pwd`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwd).

They were both executed as commands on the local system. (Whereas the `/whoami` with slash was not a system executable but a built-in command.)

In order to avoid confusion with certain terms which are both typically valid UNIX command names but also valid natural language words which you may well start a prompt to the LLM, a hard-coded list excludes them from being executed as commands (e.g. `who` and `time` or `uptime` etc.).

Prefixing input with $ followed by a space (to avoid potential future confusion with environment variables) will force it to be interpreted as a command to be executed instead (e.g. `$ uptime`).

## AI

If you have [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) up and running locally on its default port `11434`, then this _Chat_ will have an `LLM>` participant using [`gemma3:1b`](https://ai.google.dev/gemma) which will chime into the conversation, like this:

```sh
$ ./enola chat
Welcome here! Type /help if you're lost.

vorburger@yara in #Lobby> hi
LLM> Hi there! How’s your day going so far? 😊
Is there anything you'd like to chat about, or anything I can help you with today?

vorburger@yara in #Lobby> how ya feel'
LLM> As an AI, I don't have feelings in the same way humans do. However, I can say that I’m functioning well and ready to assist you! 😊

It’s a good day for me to be here. How about you? How are *you* feeling today?
```

This will be extended to support other 🔮 LLMs and 🪛 Tools and 🕵🏾‍♀️ Agents in the future - watch this space.

## SSH

This _Chat_ feature is [also available via an SSH server](../server/index.md#ssh)!

[Exec](#exec) is only enabled in (local) `enola chat`, but disabled over SSH.

`/whoami` includes the public key of the user connected over SSH.

## Configuration

Your [`~/.inputrc` and `/etc/inputrc`](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/12.3/chapter09/inputrc.html) are loaded on startup. [For example](https://github.com/vorburger/vorburger-dotfiles-bin-etc/blob/032a76d83ec26a79b84dc44e0e7b8a52132812ab/dotfiles/.inputrc#L36), to bind `Ctrl-Backspace`, do `echo '"\C-h": backward-kill-word' >> ~/.inputrc`.

The line editor has _mouse support,_ e.g. to click on the prompt line to move the cursor.

History is persisted e.g. in `~/.local/share/enola/history`.

[See Help doc](../help/index.md#chat) for all other options.
