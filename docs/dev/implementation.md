# Implementation Details

## Enola Thing (ET üëΩ)

<!-- TODO Generate (some of) this MD from a machine readable RDF model/enola.dev/et.ttl, using Enola itself?! -->

All ETs have 0.. n properties. Each such Property is identified by [an IRI](../concepts/uri.md), and has a value. Each such value has a Type. These types include e.g. text (string), numbers, or dates - but also lists, and ‚Äúnested" sub-properties. There is actually no fixed set of known such types; applications can define their own.

All ET have an IRI. Note that you may see what looks like an exception to this rule with the ‚Äúnested‚Äù ETs, which RDF and LD call "blank nodes‚Äù; in Enola we strictly speaking conceptually don't call those things, just "maps of properties‚Äù.

All this is, of course, heavily inspired by [TBL‚Äôs vision of the _‚ÄùSemantic Web"_ of _‚ÄùLinked Data‚Äù,_](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData) such as also expressed by standards such as RDF or JSON-LD.

ETs have a number of different (but ultimately semantically equivalent) representations, both internally in Enola's code as well as externally serialized in resources.

### Internal Data Types

#### Java ‚òï Thing

* Java Type: `dev.enola.thing.Thing` <!-- TODO https://github.com/enola-dev/enola/issues/491: Link to Java Doc -->

The Java `Thing` API is an _interface_ which has several available implementations. The simplest one is the `dev.enola.thing.ImmutableThing` with its _Builder._

#### Proto Thing

* Defined in: [`common/thing/thing.proto`](../../common/thing/thing.proto), see [Proto doc](proto/thing.md#dev-enola-thing-thing)
* Java Type: `dev.enola.thing.proto.Thing` <!-- TODO https://github.com/enola-dev/enola/issues/491: Link to Java Doc -->

#### Proto Message

Any [Protocol Buffer](https://protobuf.dev) can be [converted](#conversions) to a _Thing_ by Enola.

#### RDF4j Model

* Java Type: [`org.eclipse.rdf4j.model.Model`](https://rdf4j.org/javadoc/latest/org/eclipse/rdf4j/model/Model.html)

<!-- TODO #### Java Object: Any `java.lang.Object` can be [converted](#conversions) to a _Thing_ by Enola. -->

### External Serialization Formats

#### RDF Turtle üê¢

* Media Type: `text/turtle`
* Filename extension: `.ttl`
* Wikipedia: [Turtle Syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(syntax))
* W3C Spec: [w3.org/TR/turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/)
* Example: [picasso.ttl](../../common/rdf/src/test/resources/picasso.ttl)

<!-- TODO #### RDF TriG-star üìê -->

<!-- TODO #### JSON LD -->

<!-- TODO #### YAML LD -->

<!-- TODO #### Enola own's future Thing YAML format ? -->

#### Proto Thing YAML

* Media Type: `text/enola.dev#thing+yaml` (from `dev.enola.thing.ThingMediaTypes`)
* Filename extension: `.thing.yaml`
* Example: [picasso.thing.yaml](../../common/rdf/src/test/resources/picasso.thing.yaml)

#### Proto Thing Text

* Media Type: `text/protobuf?proto-message=dev.enola.thing.Thing` (from `dev.enola.thing.ThingMediaTypes`)
* Filename extension: `.textproto`

### Conversions

<!-- Eventually this Mermaid (and also a Graphviz) should also be generated from a machine readable model/enola.dev/et.ttl -->

<!-- TODO Conversion from/to arbitrary Proto Message Java objects -->

``` mermaid
graph BT
  ProtoThing[Proto Thing]
  ProtoMessage[Proto Message]
  RDF4jModel(RDF4j Model)
  RDFTurtle["RDF Turtle üê¢"]
  JavaThing("Java ‚òï Thing")

  ProtoThing-- "ThingAdapter" -->JavaThing
  JavaThing-- "??? TBD ???" -->ProtoThing
  ProtoMessage-- "MessageToThingConverter" -->ProtoThing

  JavaThing<-- "ThingConverterInto" -->JavaThing

  RDF4jModel-- "RdfThingConverter" -->ProtoThing
  ProtoThing-- "ThingRdfConverter" -->RDF4jModel
  RDF4jModel-- "RdfWriterConverter" -->RDFTurtle
  RDFTurtle-- "RdfReaderConverterInto" -->RDF4jModel
```

<!-- TODO Conversion from Java objects, once available -->
