# Enola.dev Common Java Framework

Enola's code base includes _"common"_ technical framework components which are not specific to Enola:

1. [Secret](https://docs.enola.dev/dev/javadoc/dev/enola/common/secret/package-summary.html): A credentials managers, with e.g. [`age`](https://age-encryption.org) and [`pass`](https://www.passwordstore.org) etc. integration
1. [Context](https://docs.enola.dev/dev/javadoc/dev/enola/common/context/package-summary.html): Implicit context passing, via Thread Local and `ScopedValue` (JEP 446 - TBD)
1. [Functional](https://docs.enola.dev/dev/javadoc/dev/enola/common/function/package-summary.html), notably [`MoreStreams`](https://docs.enola.dev/dev/javadoc/dev/enola/common/function/MoreStreams.html) with the [`Sneaker`](https://docs.enola.dev/dev/javadoc/dev/enola/common/function/Sneaker.html)
1. I/O: [Resource](https://docs.enola.dev/dev/javadoc/dev/enola/common/io/resource/package-summary.html), with [URL utils](https://docs.enola.dev/dev/javadoc/dev/enola/common/io/iri/package-summary.html), the [Media Types](https://docs.enola.dev/dev/javadoc/dev/enola/common/io/mediatype/package-summary.html) and [hashing](https://docs.enola.dev/dev/javadoc/dev/enola/common/io/hashbrown/package-summary.html)
1. [Convert](https://docs.enola.dev/dev/javadoc/dev/enola/common/convert/package-summary.html): Extensible Java object conversion framework

These are already available via [our Maven Repo](maven.md), as seen e.g. in the [JBang](jbang.md) usage examples.
