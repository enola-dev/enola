# IDE

## Eclipse

Eclipse is not actively supported by this project as an IDE. 

It may work using the [Bazel Eclipse Feature](https://github.com/salesforce/bazel-eclipse/blob/main/docs/bef/README.md), but this has not been tested yet.

We recommend using VSC.

## Visual Studio Code (VSC)

[The code style used in this project](style.md) can be enforced while typing using the following VSC plugins, which will automagically pick up their options from the respective configuration files in this repository:

* [`.editorconfig`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)

* For Bazel support:

      * [VSC Bazel](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BazelBuild.vscode-bazel) for syntax highlighting, linting and formatting `BUILD` files

      * [VSC Bazel for Java, by Salesforce](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sfdc.bazel-vscode-java) for Java support (it's **awesome,** and much better than [alternatives](https://github.com/vorburger/LearningBazel/blob/85aee3c956cbb84c8cd7d4f317be8ac36b62bad8/ToDo.md)). You may have to right-click on (the right "level" of) some folders to _Synchronize Projects with Bazel View_ to resolve weird initial problems like e.g. _Implicit super constructor Object() is undefined for default constructor. Must define an explicit constructor._ or _The import cannot be resolved._ or _cannot be resolved to a type_ or _The method is undefined for the type_ etc.

* [google-java-format](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=google-java-format&target=VSCode&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Relevance) TODO pick which one of the 8 to use ðŸ˜¸

* [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)

* [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

* [protolint](https://github.com/plexsystems/vscode-protolint), which requires `protolint`:

        go install github.com/yoheimuta/protolint/cmd/protolint@latest

* For `*.proto` & `*.textproto`:

      * [proto3](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zxh404.vscode-proto3)
      * [TextProto](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=thejustinwalsh.textproto-grammer)
      * [Clang Formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Seaube.clangformat), which requires `clang-package`:

            sudo apt get install clang-format
            # sudo dnf install clang-format

## Web IDE

In order to work on this project with a purely Web-based IDE, which is great to hack from e.g. a Tablet or Work Computer or some such setup,
we recommend you use [Visual Studio Code for the Web](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/vscode-web) at https://vscode.dev
together with a [Remote Tunnel](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/vscode-web#_use-your-own-compute-with-remote-tunnels)
e.g. to a computer at home, or a VM in the Cloud.

## JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA (IJ)

IJ can be used as a complete alternative to VSC, or only for Java coding, with:

* [Bazel](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8609-bazel-for-intellij) from [ij.bazel.build](https://ij.bazel.build)
  (You [have to manually change](https://github.com/bazelbuild/intellij/issues/4693) the
  _Bazel Binary Location_ from the default `bazel` to `bazelisk`.)

* [Google Java Format](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8527-google-java-format)

* [Bamboo Soy](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9841-bamboo-soy) for `*.soy` templates

## Other

Some [people prefer coding using ðŸ™Š](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war) `hexedit` or one its derivatives ðŸ˜ˆ such as `vi` or `emacs`.

You can [just launch the `./test.bash` script to automatically format code](style.md) while coding locally when using other IDEs.

Or contribute to this page to document how to set up your favorite editor.
