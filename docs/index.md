Thanks for checking out this project! Starring it helps with visibility and shows your support.

Enola [is](concepts/whatis.md) many things, including [an awesome Agentic AI tool](agents/index.md).

<!-- TODO
Enola will also be a useful tool which helps IT ⛑️ Sysadmins,
[Site Reliability Engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_reliability_engineering)
(see [Google's SRE page](https://sre.google)), and other _samideanaj adminopsions_ to
document their systems and relationships. This increased visibility (knowledge management)
helps to investigate the root causes of complex production issues (troubleshoot)
to operate them reliably with efficiency.

Enola has a _model_ of an organization's IT landscape,
offering a _"single pane of glass"_ (SPOG) view of it.
This mimics the _"picture in the head"_ that knowledgeable senior engineers
typically have of systems, their relations, failure modes, etc. All too often
these are incompletely fully captured by existing mechanisms. Teams often do
have e.g. related documents, Playbooks, various ad-hoc scripts etc.
This tool can bring them all together, fully integrated. An organization can
do this incrementally over time, improving with each incident
([until 🔮](concepts/singularity.md)).
It complements [related existing tools](concepts/other.md).

We call this _"Infrastructure as Linked Data"_ graphs.

<!-- Due to its inherently modular underlying technical framework, its internal data model is highly extensible to a variety
of environments by modeling concepts from private environments and writing bespoke custom API connectors for in-house setups. -->

<!-- TODO The actual usage of [the underlying core](core.md) can be illustrated e.g. by its [Kubernetes Edition](k8s/index.md). -->

<!-- TODO Re-add, later: <sub>PS: The name "Enola" was originally inspired by the project's creator having watched the _Enola Holmes_ 🕵🏾‍♀️ detective movie with his daughter, and this is an SRE detective's tool!</sub> -->
