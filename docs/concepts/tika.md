# Tika

Enola in addition to RDF üê¢ TTL etc. can also read many other common file formats
(see [`enola info`](../use/info/index.md)).
This is courtesy of [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org),
see its [Supported Document Formats
](https://tika.apache.org/3.0.0-BETA2/formats.html).

All of these formats are supported e.g. for conversions with [Rosetta](../use/rosetta/index.md) but also `--load` for [Get](../use/get/index.md), [DocGen](../use/docgen/index.md) and [Server](../use/server/index.md), etc.

<!-- TODO Markdown?! With links, not just Metadata? -->

<!-- NB: The following commands are not run through ExecMD! Add to test-cli.bash... -->

## HTML

```bash
./enola -v rosetta --in test/test.html --out="fd:2?mediaType=text/turtle"
```

This works for remote HTTP as well, of course:

```bash
./enola rosetta --http-scheme --in https://docs.enola.dev --out="fd:2?mediaType=text/turtle"
```

## Image

```bash
./enola -v get --http-scheme \
  --load https://www.vorburger.ch/michael_vorburger_portrait_in_bay_of_roses_spain_with_bad_lighting.jpg \
  https://www.vorburger.ch/michael_vorburger_portrait_in_bay_of_roses_spain_with_bad_lighting.jpg
```

## EPUB

Any `*.epub` (`application/epub+zip`).

## Executable

```bash
./enola -v rosetta --in /usr/lib64/libsane.so.1 --out="fd:2?mediaType=text/turtle"
```
