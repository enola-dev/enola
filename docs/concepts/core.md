# Core

Enola üïµüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Core is a _library_ of [generic concepts of Enola's problem space](core-arch.md).

It is independent of "domains" such as Network, Linux, Kubernetes, Web, etc.

End-users use Enola through different "editions". Organization can build their own
internal editions of Enola, to interface with their proprietary in-house systems.

This Core's functionality which [is implemented](implementation.md) and exposed through different _Tools._
<!-- TODO ? The focus of the initial work is the `be` CLI tool, as illustrated by the [Kubernetes Edition](../k8s/index.md). -->

Enola at its core can be viewed as a
[Knowledge Management tool](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_management)
to describe an [Ontology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)).
It _models_ real world concepts as what it terms _Entities,_ [identified by URI](uri.md), and models their _references_ both
across its Entities, as well as to arbitrary non-Enola URIs. (This notably includes traditional
URLs like HTTP links, which models can use to create hyperlinks to UIs of applications managing Entities.)

Enola has [built-in interchangeable support](../use/rosetta/index.md) for JSON, YAML, and Text proto
[wire formats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_data-serialization_formats) for entities.
<!-- TODO In the future, maybe (binary!) PB? FHIR? Blockchain EVM format? -->

Enola currently uses [Proto 3](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/) as its
Schema language, but is conceptually open to supporting other kinds of schemas in the future; perhaps e.g.
[JSON Schema](https://github.com/enola-dev/enola/issues/313), or XSD XML Schema, or
[ASN.1](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASN.1) or [GNU poke](https://www.gnu.org/software/poke/).
