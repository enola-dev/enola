# XML

Enola can read Things from XML (any, non-RDF!); see [Rosetta](../use/rosetta/index.md#xml).

This _"direct"_ XML support is different from its ["RDF XML"](xml-rdf.md) support.

The [Tika](tika.md) multi-format I/O internally uses this XML support.

Writing Things converted to XML is still TBD.

## Mapping

## Attributes & Elements

Both XML _attributes_ and _elements_ are converted to Thing properties / RDF statements.

## Text

Text content from XML may be directly used as string objects of Things' property / RDF statements.

If this is not possible, then it is wrapped in `https://enola.dev/text` properties.

This depends on whether there are other elements.

## Namespaces

[Namespaces](namespaces.md) of XML are supported, both default and with prefixes.

If no `xmlns` is set, the resource's URI is used as fallback instead.

As XML default namespaces do not apply to attributes, they must use a prefix.

### Empty

An XML input consisting only of an empty `<root/>` like element is considered "empty" (no Things).

An XML input without any bytes is valid, and equally simply gets converted to _No Things._
