# Other Tools

## SRE & DevOps

Enola 🕵🏾‍♀️ is not an Observability / Monitoring _(Application Performance Management, APM)_ tool. There are already many great ones, e.g. Prometheus, [Thanos](https://thanos.io), etc.
On the contrary, Enola is often set-up to integrate with and read data from existing monitoring tools,
if available.

Enola 🕵🏾‍♀️ is not an Incident Management or Postmortem tool.
On the contrary, it could automate creating incidents in such tools.

Enola 🕵🏾‍♀️ is not Configuration Management tool.

Enola 🕵🏾‍♀️ is not a Communication tool.

## Knowledge Management

<!-- I would be fun to capture in a structured format, with Enola... ;-) And then generated this from that! -->

### Personal

Enola 🕵🏾‍♀️  may in the future have some [Personal Knowledge Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) like features similar to tools such as:

* [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
* [Logseq](https://logseq.com)
* [Cosma](https://cosma.arthurperret.fr)
* [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org)
* [The Brain](https://thebrain.com)
* [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com)
* [The Archive from zettelkasten.de](https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/)
* [Zettelkasten history on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten)

<!-- TODO ### Shared what was Bundesarchive's Linked Data (not 'Knowledge Graph') thing? -->

## Persistence

Enola 🕵🏾‍♀️ might not become a (persistent) "database" itself - but could integrate with some in the future?

### Graph

* [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com)

### Vector

* [ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com)
* [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io)
