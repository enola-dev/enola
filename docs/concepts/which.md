Humans [name :snowman: things](https://youtube.com/TODO) <!-- youtube:3 MÃ¤nner im Schnee, "Der Mensch muss heissen", Kazimir) -->.
Because they are :brain: so smart, they usually know _what_ things they're talking about with these _names_ (often from _"context")._

Computers on the other hand are pretty stupid, and it helps them to have crystal clear unique names of what's what; so Enola uses the following.

## URL

An _"Uniform Resource Locator"_ ([[URL]]) is well-known e.g. as the [[Text]] which you can type into your [[web browsers]]'s address bar. Your browser "fetches" (gets) the [[enola:Resource]] which that URL _"points to"_ - and displays its content to you. Examples of this are:

* <https://google.com> the homepage of the Google Web Search Engine
* <https://google.com?q=Enola.dev> the web page showing the results of a Google search for "Enola.dev"
* <https://www.w3.org/assets/logos/w3c/w3c-no-bars.svg> the logo of the W3C

<!-- TODO Callout with Note: or NOTE: or a different syntax? -->

NOTE: URL are actually a lot less great than one may think at first for really uniquely naming things. For example, <https://google.com> and <https://google.com/> (note the trailing `/` slash) are "the same thing" in practice (that homepage) - as is <https://www.google.com/> (note the `www` prefix), or in some other cases something like `https://www.google.com/index.html`.

URLs have _"schemas"_ - that's the string like `https` - anything before the `:` colon, really. The `https` e.g. means "get it via [[enola:net/HTTP]], and `mailto:` e.g. means "this is an [[enola:email/address]] that you can send an [[Email]] to".

<!-- TODO Move Enola CLI usage examples to a separate linked next page, with same headings? -->

Enola supports URLs, of different schemes; here is how to see which:

```bash
$ ./enola info schemes
http: HyperText Transfer Protocol; see https://enola.dev/net/http (also https:)
file: ...
...
```

Enola can "fetch" the content that an URL points to, like this:

```bash
$ ./enola get http://vorburger.ch/hi
hello, world
```

Getting an URL can raise various errors:

```bash
$ ./enola get http://bad.tld/hi
Error: Could not resolve bad.tld
```

BTW, fun fact: The _#fragment_ (e.g. in `https://server/path#fragment`) of a URL is not relevant for fetching an URL (only e.g. for scrolling to header in displaying); notice how it doesn't change anything here:

```bash
$ ./enola get http://vorburger.ch/hi#there
hello, world
```

## IRI

An _"Internationalized Resource Identifier"_ ([[IRI]) is something fairly different than an [[URL]].

This can, but don't necceessarily really have to,
which can be a bit confusing, at first.

Sometimes can be fetched - but this is not a hard requirement of _Linked Data,_ and so sometimes you cannot.
