# Namespaces

Enola supports _Namespaces_ with _prefixes_ for shorter and thus more easily human readable [CURIEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURIE).

Several of the Enola's [formats](core.md#formats), notably both [üê¢ Turtle](turtle.md) and [XML](xml.md), can read and write with namespace support.

Formats with namespace support include a custom syntax to declare namespaces (`@prefix` and `xmlns:`), which is used when reading them. This is purely an I/O convenience; in the internal data store those prefixes are not used.

When showing things on the UI, or when writing out things in formats with namespace support, Enola uses its _active_ prefix map. The supported namespaces are currently [hard-coded](https://github.com/enola-dev/enola/blob/main/java/dev/enola/common/io/iri/namespace/NamespaceRepositoryEnolaDefaults.java).

The plan is to make the active prefix to namespace URI mappings fully configurable in the future, likely using [`https://enola.dev/namespaces`](https://docs.enola.dev/models/enola.dev/namespaces/).

## Design

Enola recommends using _[slash namespaces](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/BestPractices/VM/http-examples/2006-01-18/#slash)_ instead of _[hash namespaces](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/BestPractices/VM/http-examples/2006-01-18/#hash)_ for new vocabularies.

In our experience, this is less confusing in some situations (e.g. [TTL BASE](turtle.md#base)).
