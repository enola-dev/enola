# RDF/XML

Enola will be able to read and write its _Things_ in RDF XML in the future.

This format is only recommended for any required data exchange; [🐢 Turtle](turtle.md) is generally suggested otherwise as it's much easier to read and write by humans.

This _"RDF XML"_ support is different from Enola's ["direct XML"](xml.md) support.

<!-- TODO Link to [Rosetta](../use/rosetta/index.md#xml-rdf) example when implemented. -->
