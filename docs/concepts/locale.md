# Localization & Internationalization

Enola supports localization (i10n) & internationalization (i18n) out of the box.

## Locale

By default, Enola uses the system's locale:

```sh
$ ./enola test-locale
Now is May 17, 2025, 5:48:06 PM CEST
```

This can be overridden by setting an OS specific mechanism; on Linux with the `LANG` environment variable:

```sh
LANG=de_CH ./enola test-locale
Now is 17. Mai 2025, 17:54:06 MESZ
```

The Enola CLI also supports a `--locale` option (note the use of `-` hyphen instead of `_` underscore):

```sh
$ ./enola --locale=fr-CH test-locale
Now is 17 mai 2025, 17:55:55 CEST
```

## Time Zone

By default, Enola uses the system's TZ, as seen above.

This can be overridden by setting an OS specific mechanism; on Linux with the `TZ` environment variable:

```sh
TZ=America/New_York ./enola test-locale
Now is May 17, 2025, 12:00:18 PM EDT
```

The Enola CLI also supports a `--timeZone` option (note the use of `-` hyphen instead of `_` underscore):

```sh
./enola --timeZone=Europe/Zurich test-locale
Now is May 17, 2025, 6:02:25 PM CEST
```
