# Agent üïµüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

_Agents_ use a _[Large Language Model (LLM)](../specs/aiuri/index.md#language-models-lm)_ to reason, plan, and execute actions to achieve a specific goal, often interacting with _[Tools](tool.md)._ They augment LLMs to go beyond just generating text by enabling them to perform tasks and solve problems proactively.

Enola lets you easily create ‚Äòopinionated‚Äô (‚Äúonly one way to do it‚Äù) _No Code_ agents
declaratively in YAML or JSON (and maybe TextProto later), based on its [Agent Schema](https://github.com/enola-dev/enola/blob/main/models/enola.dev/ai/agent.schema.yaml).

**[Check out the tutorial](../tutorial/agents.md)!**

## Schema

<!-- NB: This is copy/pasted from agent.schema.yaml; please keep them (manually, for now) in sync! TODO Add a JSON Schema Documentation Generator to Enola, and use it to gen agent.schema.md and link to that from here... -->

See https://github.com/enola-dev/enola/tree/main/test/agents for examples.

### Instruction

Instructions for LLM model, guiding the agent's behaviour. You should describe concisely what the agent will do, when it should defer to other agents/tools, and how it should respond to the user.

### Description

One-line description of the agent's capability. The model uses this to determine whether to delegate control to the agent.

### Name

Name ("nick") of agent. Typically, it's set automatically by a loader from a portion of the origin URL. <!-- This is just a recommendation, and a loader could change it if another agent (with another ID) already uses this name. Users can also change the nicknames of their agents. -->

## Tools

[Tools](tool.md) to which the agent has access, including [MCP](mcp.md).

## TODO

_Agents will soon allow configuring parallel (or sequential) and "looped" execution of other agents!_
