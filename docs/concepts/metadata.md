# Metadata

Enola uses Metadata about all of its _Things_ when rendering them:

<!-- This describes the dev.enola.common.io.metadata.Metadata record; keep it updated, if it ever changes. -->

* label is a normally fairly short human-readable üè∑Ô∏è text; e.g. TITLE of HTML page found at the IRI, or something similar.
* description is a longer human-readable üìú description; e.g. first paragraph or `<meta ... description>` of a HTML page.
* image of a logo; e.g. from [favicon](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon) or something like that; or an üòÉ Emoji!
* curie is a compact URI; a shorter form of the original "long" IRI of the Thing.

<!-- The following documents the dev.enola.thing.metadata.ThingMetadataProvider service; keep it updated, if it ever changes. -->

## Label

This is read from a number of "typical" properties; in order of priority:

1. [http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label](../models/www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema/label.md)
1. https://schema.org/name
1. http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title

If the thing itself doesn't have any of these, it will check if its [RDFS range](../models/www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema/range.md) has any.

This is always available; if a Thing has none of the above, then it will fallback to the CURIE, or else just the last part of its IRI.

## Description

This is also read from a number of "typical" properties; in order of priority:

1. https://schema.org/description
1. https://schema.org/abstract
1. http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description
1. [http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment](../models/www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema/comment.md)

This is optional and may be empty.

## Image of Logo

This is read, again in order from:

1. [https://enola.dev/emoji](../models/enola.dev/emoji.md)
1. https://schema.org/logo
1. https://schema.org/thumbnailUrl
1. https://schema.org/image

On the Thing itself, or via its [RDFS range](../models/www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema/range.md) or
[RDF type](../models/www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns/type.md).

## CURIE

The CURIE is determined by the current context.

This could be different than e.g. a prefix in a loaded [Turtle](turtle.md).
