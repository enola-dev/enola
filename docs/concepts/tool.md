# Tool üß∞

_Tools_ allow [Agents](agent.md) to access information which is not in a _[Large Language Model (LLM)](../specs/aiuri/index.md#language-models-lm)_ and to interact with their environment.

## Clock üï∞Ô∏è

```yaml
{% include "../../test/agents/clock.agent.yaml" %}
```

This `clock` tool makes the current date and time available to a model:

```shell
$ enola ai --lm="google://?model=gemini-2.5-flash-lite" --in "What's the time?"
I cannot tell you the current time. I do not have access to real-time information.

$ enola ai --agents=test/agents/clock.agent.yaml --in "What's the time?"
The current date & time in CET is Saturday, August 16, 2025, 11:42 PM.
```

## Exec

**TODO** _Enola is planning to offer an `exec` tool. We intended to make this highly configurable._

## Google üîé üåê

```yaml
{% include "../../test/agents/google.agent.yaml" %}
```

This `search_google` tool makes the [Google Search Engine](https://search.google/) available:

```shell
$ enola ai --lm="google://?model=gemini-2.5-flash-lite" --in "What happened today?"
As a large language model, I don't have access to real-time information or a concept of "today." My knowledge cutoff is **June 2024**, so I can't tell you what happened today specifically.

$ enola ai --agents=test/agents/google.agent.yaml --in "What happened today?"
Here's a summary of what happened on August 16, 2025:

**International News:**
*   The Indian tricolor was hoisted atop Seattle's iconic Space Needle for the first time, coinciding with India's 79th Independence Day celebrations.

(...)
**Other Notable Events:**
*   August 16th is recognized as National Airborne Day, National Bratwurst Day, National Rum Day, National Roller Coaster Day, and National Tell a Joke Day.
```

This tool is currently only supported [on Gemini](../specs/aiuri/index.md#google-ai-).

## MCP

[MCP](mcp.md) allows Enola to access many thousands of other tools!
