# Tool üß∞

_Tools_ allow [Agents](agent.md) to access information which is not in a _[Large Language Model (LLM)](../specs/aiuri/index.md#language-models-lm)_ and to interact with their environment.

## Clock üï∞Ô∏è

```yaml
{% include "../../test/agents/clock.agent.yaml" %}
```

This `clock` tool makes the current date and time available to a model:

```shell
$ enola ai --lm="google://?model=gemini-2.5-flash-lite" --in "What's the time?"
I cannot tell you the current time. I do not have access to real-time information.

$ enola ai --agents=test/agents/clock.agent.yaml --in "What's the time?"
The current date & time in CET is Saturday, August 16, 2025, 11:42 PM.
```

## Exec ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

The `exec` tool can be used to run any command; for example, for something like this:

```yaml
{% include "../../test/agents/linux-system-summary.agent.yaml" %}
```

When this Agent is run, it would print (something like) this:

```shell
$ enola ai --agents=test/agents/linux-system-summary.agent.yaml --in="do it"

Xeon CPU runs fast,
Twelve cores, power strong.
Memory 62GiB,
56GiB now in use.
One day, twenty-one mins.
System running well,
Tasks flow with ease.
```

!!! danger "Security Consideration"

    The exec tool is very powerful, as it can run any shell command if added to an agent. This may introduce a significant security risk, as a compromised or manipulated prompt or instruction could lead to arbitrary code execution on the machine running Enola. Note that Enola (currently) does not yet double-check tool execution with the user. Please carefully consider this when using this tool.

    **TODO** _We intended to make this highly configurable in the future._

## Google üîé üåê

```yaml
{% include "../../test/agents/google.agent.yaml" %}
```

This `search_google` tool makes the [Google Search Engine](https://search.google/) available:

```shell
$ enola ai --lm="google://?model=gemini-2.5-flash-lite" --in "What happened today?"
As a large language model, I don't have access to real-time information or a concept of "today." My knowledge cutoff is **June 2024**, so I can't tell you what happened today specifically.

$ enola ai --agents=test/agents/google.agent.yaml --in "What happened today?"
Here's a summary of what happened on August 16, 2025:

**International News:**
*   The Indian tricolor was hoisted atop Seattle's iconic Space Needle for the first time, coinciding with India's 79th Independence Day celebrations.

(...)
**Other Notable Events:**
*   August 16th is recognized as National Airborne Day, National Bratwurst Day, National Rum Day, National Roller Coaster Day, and National Tell a Joke Day.
```

This tool is currently only supported [on Gemini](../specs/aiuri/index.md#google-ai-).

## Files üìÇ

The following built-in tools let an Agent work with the filesystem:

* `read_file`: Reads the entire content of a specified file.
* `write_file`: Writes content into a file.
* `edit_file`: Replaces a specific range of lines in a file and returns a git-style diff of the changes.
* `search_files`: Recursively searches for files and directories using a glob pattern.
* `list_directory`: Lists the files and directory contents of a given directory with, with details like size and modification date.
* `create_directory`: Creates a directory, including any necessary parent directories.
* `grep_file`: Searches for a text pattern within a file.

```shell
enola ai -a test/agents/filesystem.agent.yaml --in="list the files in $PWD"
```

!!! danger "Security Consideration"

    The filesystem related tools are very powerful, because when enabled in an agent, they can currently access the full filesystem. This may introduce a significant security risk, as a compromised or manipulated prompt or instruction could unintentionally expose data from sensitive files on the machine running Enola. Note that Enola (currently) does not yet double-check tool execution with the user. Please carefully consider this when using this tool, and only add actually required tools to agents.

    **TODO** _We intended to be able to limit accessible directories (like MCP roots) in the future._

## MCP

[MCP](mcp.md) allows Enola to access many thousands of other tools!
