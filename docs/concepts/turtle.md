# RDF Turtle üê¢ Model Language Format Syntax

Turtle üê¢ is the _"Terse Resource Description Framework (RDF) Triple Language"_ (TTL).

It's a textual syntax format to write down models of linked things.

This page serves as a brief "cheat sheet" about its syntax.

[The tutorial](../models/example.org/hello.md) elaborates further, incl. alt. formats.

<!-- TODO Write an 'extractor' which pulls ```turtle out of MD, loads, and validates syntax! -->

## Short

The following "full" 3 _Subject - Predicate - Object_ statements:

```turtle
<http://example.org/thing1> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://example.org/Example>.
<http://example.org/thing1> <http://example.org/name> "First Thing".
<http://example.org/thing1> <http://example.org/next> <http://example.org/thing2>.
```

are typically written in this completely equivalent shorter form, with _predicate lists:_

```turtle
<http://example.org/thing1> a <http://example.org/Example>;
  <http://example.org/name> "First Thing";
  <http://example.org/next> <http://example.org/thing2>.
```

## Prefix

<!-- TODO Promote using "PREFIX" instead of "@prefix" to align TTL with SPARQL, and more YAML friendly?
     But it doesn't work; RDF4j probably needs some flag... -->

The initial example above is typically written even shorter, but semantically equivalently, by declaring prefixes, and using [CURIEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURIE) instead:

```turtle
@prefix ex: <http://example.org/>.

ex:thing1 a ex:Example;
  ex:name "First Thing";
  ex:next ex:thing2.
```

There can be several different such prefixes, of course. We can also define (a single one) _default prefix:_

```turtle
@prefix : <http://example.org/>.

:thing1 a :Example;
  :name "First Thing";
  :next :thing2.
```

## Base

Relative instead of absolute IRIs are allowed. By default, they are interpreted as based on "where the TTL is" (e.g. `file:/...`). What you typically want however is to declare an explicit absolute `@base`; e.g. we could also write our example from above like this if we wanted:

```turtle
@base <http://example.org/>.

<thing1> a <Example>;
  <name> "First Thing";
  <next> <thing2>.
```

This variant is valid, and again semantically equivalently to above, but much less commonly used.

## Object Lists

Here is our thing with 2 more names, note the `,` (comma) in the `:name` line:

```turtle
@prefix : <http://example.org/>.

:thing1 a :Example;
  :name "Thing Name", "Another Name";
  :next :thing2.
```

It's important to understand that with this syntax the names are **unordered**.

## Collection

The `(...)` instead of `,` syntax preserves order (and it is represented differently internally):

```turtle
@prefix : <http://example.org/>.

:thing1 a :Example;
  :names ("First Name", "Middle Name", "Last Name");
  :next :thing2.
```

## Nest

The `[...]` syntax make this _Thing_ contain another nested _Thing_ (which is "anonymous", and internally represented using a _"blank node"):_

```turtle
@prefix : <http://example.org/>.

:thing1 a :Example;
  :nest [
    :name "Another Thing";
    :next :thing2
  ].
```

<!-- TODO ## Graph

          Because Enola can extract Turtle from Markdown, we can produce the following view of the above:

          <!--exec:graphviz ../../enola --load docs/concepts/turtle.md rosetta http://example.org/thing1 -o=fd:1?mediaType=text/markdown - ->

          As well as this graph diagram visualization:

          ```graphviz ../../enola --load docs/concepts/turtle.md rosetta -o=fd:1?mediaType=text/vnd.graphviz
          ```
  -->
