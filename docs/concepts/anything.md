## Words

When you say _gift_ then I am not entirely sure what you mean...
probably a üéÅ - or did you maybe refer to the German word _Gift,_
which is üíÄ poison in English?

In our everyday natural language, there is often _context_ which helps us to disambiguate.
But how could I (or a computer) **really** know what you meant? Well, we'll just provide context!

So to make it clearer (and even unambiguous), we just specify a _Type_ for context.
For example, we could say _the English word gift_ (or alternatively _the German word Gift_ instead).

More formally, if you gave me (an of _[ordered pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair)_ of)
both _"gift"_ and _English_ then I can be certain that you mean a üéÅ and are not giving me üíÄ.

## Datatype

## Identifier

When you say _0-13-140731-7,_ what do you mean? I'm again not really sure, and it could refer to a number of different _Things._

Perhaps you meant it as [an _International Standard Book Number_ (ISBN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN), to _identify_ the [Core Java Data Objects](https://www.vorburger.ch/corejdo/) book?

maybe... "Intelligent Systems for Biological Nomenclature"

As above
So _0-13-140731-7,_

## IRI

do not "DIY" (AKA "Do Identifiers by Yourself")

## URL

mention URI

https://www.xn--dv-bja.dev

## Literals

when you say _1_ probably a number (1)

Similarly, you could say _the Integer 1._ But now what exactly is an _Integer..._
the [mathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer)_ (unbounded), or
some _[technical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_(computer_science))_ (32bit? 64bit? un-/signed?) one?

Again, we need some way to uniquely identify these different types.
You could probably easily think of a few different ways to identify something uniquely?
For example, we could make up long numbers that we both agreed upon beforehand,
and figure out some way to keep them unique in the world.
But this would be tedious.

Another way would be to use some sort of "uniquely identifying name" in text form.
For example, `integer-math-unbounded` vs `integer-tech-32bit-signed`.

as long as we both agreed on this.

Added advantage that you could type that into your web browser.
