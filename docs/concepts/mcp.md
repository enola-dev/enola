# MCP ðŸ”±

The ðŸ”± [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) is a standard for ðŸ§° [Tools](tool.md).

## Configuration

The `--mcp` CLI argument specifies which MCP servers are available to Agents.

If not specified it uses the built-in [`mcp.yaml`](https://github.com/enola-dev/enola/blob/main/models/enola.dev/ai/mcp.yaml) by default.

Use the names under the `servers:` key of a `mcp.yaml` in the `tools:` of [Agents](agent.md).

MCP servers are only started (or connected to), and queried for their ðŸ§° Tools, if any of the loaded `--agents` use them.

## Examples

<!-- Generate these, from an example prompt in YAML... -->

### Everything

The [`everything` MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/everything) has a number of tools useful for testing:

```shell
enola ai --agents=test/agents/everything.agent.yaml --in "Print environment variables to debug MCP"
```

### Fetch

The [`fetch` MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/fetch) can fetch a webpage, and extract its contents as Markdown:

```shell
enola ai -a test/agents/fetch.agent.yaml --in="What is on https://docs.enola.dev/tutorial/agents/ ?"
```

CAUTION: This server can access local/internal IP addresses, which may represent a security risk.
Exercise caution when using this MCP server to ensure this does not expose any sensitive data!

## CLI

To debug MCP, use the dedicated [MCP CLI commands](../use/mcp/index.md).
