# Singularity 🔮

The [🔮 Singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity), for an Org using Enola,
is reached when this tool is no longer used to support 🕵🏾‍♀️ humans, but (only) continously runs
to detect problems and automagically mitigates and fully resolves them - without
any human intervention at all.

This is a lofty goal which may or may not ever be fully achieved in any given setup.

An interesting idea is the application of Machine Learning (ML) to this problem domain.
Enola's initial focus is not yet on this space, but we anticipate that its data model
could eventually serve as an interesting foundation enabling further exploration
of an automagic ML angle.

There are various intermediate stages towards achieving full Singularity, including:

1. Partially supporting humans with root causing
1. Fully automated root causing
1. Documented mitigation & resolution steps
1. Assisted mitigation & resolution
1. Fully automated mitigation & resolution
