# AI URI

## Introduction

[As you know](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html), _"There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things."_

This spec proposes a convention for consistently naming some _things_ related to AI with [URIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier).

These URIs are independent of any specific programming language, framework, tool, etc.

Perhaps your favorite one could adopt it!

## Language Models (LM)

### Ollama ðŸ¦™

`http://localhost:11434?type=ollama&model=gemma3:1b` is the URI of the [Gemma 3 (1B)](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/) large language model running in [Ollama](https://ollama.com), at `http://localhost:11434`.

The `model` query parameter of the URI needs to use a model name from https://ollama.com/search.

### Google AI ðŸ”®

`google://?model=gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17` is the URI of the [Gemini 2.5 Flash (Preview 04-17)](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models) LLM, used via the [Google (Gemini) AI API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/).

[For security](#security), the API key is not part of this URI, but configured elsewhere; typically in a _[secret](../../use/secret/index.md)_ named `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`. Such keys can be easily obtained by clicking on _Get API key_ in https://aistudio.google.com.

Note that the _Google (Gemini) AI API_ is a **different** API from the _Google Cloud Vertex AI Platform API._

### Mock ðŸ¦œ

`mocklm:hello,%20world` is the URI of a [mock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object) LM which, like a ðŸ¦œ parrot, always replies with _"hello, world"_ to any prompt.

## Security

It is intentional that none of these URIs contain API keys. They are configured "elsewhere", with a mechanism specific to the [supporting framework or tool](#support); typically in a _[secret](../../use/secret/index.md)._

This is primarily for security reasons, as such URIs may be used e.g. in agent configuration files stored under source control, or even shown to technical end-users in UIs.

It is also often more convenient in practice; because while the choice of a model, and its parameters, is often specific to a given Agent configuration, the specific API key really is not, and instead belongs to separate configuration.

## Related

We are not aware of any similar LM URI naming scheme. Please add any that you know of here.

## ToDo

1. Add many more URIs
1. Support (default) "standard" `?topP` / `topK`, `temperature`, `maxOutputTokens`, `seed`, `stopSequences`, `version` (?) etc. query parameters (see also [dotprompt config](https://google.github.io/dotprompt/reference/frontmatter/#config))

```english
A URI's a name,
For AI, it's the same,
Ollama, Google, ...
No longer a struggle,
To call models by name.
```
