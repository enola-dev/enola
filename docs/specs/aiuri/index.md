# AI URI

<br>_Status:_ **Ready to Implement**

## Introduction

[As you know](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html), _"There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things."_

This spec proposes a convention for consistently naming some _things_ related to AI with [URIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier).

These URIs are independent of any specific programming language, framework, tool, etc.

Perhaps your favorite one could adopt it!

## Language Models (LM)

Great for _Bring Your Own Model_ (‚ÄúBYOM‚Äù) configuration!

### Ollama ü¶ô

This is free!

`http://localhost:11434?type=ollama&model=gemma3:1b` is the URI of the [Gemma 3 (1B)](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/) large language model running in [Ollama](https://ollama.com), at `http://localhost:11434`.

The `model` query parameter of the URI needs to use a model name from https://ollama.com/search.

[MCP Tools](../../concepts/mcp.md) support may still have some bugs (see #[1628](https://github.com/enola-dev/enola/issues/1628)).

### Google AI üîÆ

This API has a very generous free tier. It requires a Google account.

`google://?model=gemini-2.5-flash` is the URI of the [Gemini 2.5 Flash](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models) LLM, used via the [Google (Gemini) AI API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/).

[For security](#security), the API key is not part of this URI, but configured in a _[secret](../../use/secret/index.md)_ named `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`. Such keys can be easily obtained by clicking on _Get API key_ in https://aistudio.google.com.

Note that the _Google (Gemini) AI API_ is a **different** API from the _Google Cloud Vertex AI Platform API._

## Anthropic Claude

This API requires registering a credit card to purchase credits.

<!-- TODO See AnthropicModelProvider re. GCP & AWS... -->

`claude://?model=claude-3-haiku-20240307` is the URI of the [Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview) LLM.

[For security](#security), the API key is not part of this URI, but configured in a _[secret](../../use/secret/index.md)_ named `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Such keys can be easily obtained on https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys.

<!-- TODO OpenAI -->

### Mock ü¶ú

`mocklm:hello,%20world` is the URI of a [mock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object) LM which, like a ü¶ú parrot, always replies with _"hello, world"_ to any prompt.

### Echo ü™û

`echo:/` is the URI of a LM which, like a ü™û mirror, always "echos back" the prompt itself.

This is sometimes suitable e.g. for testing.

### Common

Language Model (LM) may include the following common configuration URI parameters:

* `temperature`
* `topP`
* `topK`
* `maxOutputTokens`

Some models and/or the client libraries we use for them might not support some of these.

## Security

It is intentional that none of these URIs contain API keys. They are configured "elsewhere", with a mechanism specific to the [supporting framework or tool](#support); typically in a _[secret](../../use/secret/index.md)._

This is primarily for security reasons, as such URIs may be used e.g. in agent configuration files stored under source control, or even shown to technical end-users in UIs.

It is also often more convenient in practice; because while the choice of a model, and its parameters, is often specific to a given Agent configuration, the specific API key really is not, and instead belongs to separate configuration.

## Related

We are not aware of any similar LM URI naming scheme. Please add any that you know of here.

## ToDo

1. Add many more URIs
1. Add additional common parameters: `seed`, `stopSequences` etc. (see [dotprompt config](https://google.github.io/dotprompt/reference/frontmatter/#config))

```english
A URI's a name,
For AI, it's the same,
Ollama, Google, ...
No longer a struggle,
To call models by name.
```
