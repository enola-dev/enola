type: object
# These properties were originally partially inspired by the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)...
#   ... but they were never exactly entirely identical from the start anyway (e.g. id/name, model, etc.);
#   and conceptually this is really pretty general anyway, and quite similar to most other agent frameworks.

  id:
    description:
      Unique ID of agent. Uniqueness should typically be "world-wide", so it's highly recommended to use an URL.
      Typically set automatically by a loader from the origin URL.
    type: string
  name:
    description:
      Name ("nick") of agent. Typically, it's set automatically by a loader from a portion of the origin URL. This is
      just a recommendation, and a loader could change it if another agent (with another ID) already uses this name.
      Users can also change the nicknames of their agents.
    type: string
  description:
    description:
      One-line description of the agent's capability. The model uses this to determine whether to delegate control to
      the agent.
    type: string
  instruction:
    description:
      Instructions for LLM model, guiding the agent's behaviour. You should describe concisely what the agent will do,
      when it should defer to other agents/tools, and how it should respond to the user.
    type: string
  # TODO globalInstruction:
  #   description:
  #     Instructions for all the agents in the entire agent tree. ONLY the globalInstruction in the root agent
  #     will take effect. For example: use globalInstruction to make all agents have a stable identity or personality.
  # BUT in ADK this is a property of LlmAgent, not BaseAgent, so... this doesn't really make sense?!
  model:
    description:
      The language model to use, based on the Enola.dev AI URI specification <https://docs.enola.dev/specs/aiuri/>; so
      e.g. google://?model=gemini-2.5-flash. May be omitted, in which case a default one will be used.
