# Templates

Are you bored with `greeting1`, `greeting2` & `greeting3` by now? ðŸ˜¼ Fear not - Enola has a way to define **ALL** _Greetings!_ ðŸ˜¸ To learn how, check out [`greetingN.ttl`](greetingN.ttl):

```turtle
{% include "./greetingN.ttl" start="# limitations under the License.\n" %}
```

This means:

1. All `https://example.org/greet/{NUMBER}`, such as `https://example.org/greet/456` as well as `https://example.org/greet/789` (and any other) _ARE_ a `Greeting`. (See also [the `iriTemplate` property documentation](../enola.dev/iriTemplate.md).)

1. The `yo` _property_ says that **all** _Greetings_ (not just the above class!) have a link - but it depends on the `NUMBER` from the IRI; e.g. `https://example.org/greet/456` has a `yo` link to `http://example.org/hi/456` but `https://example.org/greet/789` to `http://example.org/hi/789`.

1. `https://example.org/greet/42` is one an example of such a _Greeting._

Check it out by generating documentation:

```bash cd .././.././..
$ ./enola docgen --load "file:docs/models/example.org/greetingN.ttl" --output=file:///tmp/models/ --no-index
...
```

{% include-markdown "./greeting.md" start="# `ex:greeting`" end="---" comments=false %}

Now click on the `example` link (42)... can you tell what happened?! ðŸ˜»

PS: In Technical Infrastructure Models, _Things_ like a _Machine,_ or perhaps more ephemeral concepts such _Kubernetes Pod_ might be good candidates for such _"templated Things"._
