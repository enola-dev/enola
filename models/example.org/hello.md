# Hello World

Enola captures knowledge about _Things,_ and the relationships (links) between them.

_Things_ can be represented in a variety of _[Formats](../../concepts/core.md#formats)._ In this 1st step, we'll use the RDF üê¢ Turtle format.

Let's start with this [`greeting1.ttl`](greeting1.ttl):

```turtle
{% include "./greeting1.ttl" start="# limitations under the License.\n" %}
```

This means that `https://example.org/greeting1` identifies some _Thing_ which has a `message` that is _"hello, world"._ Pretty simple, right?

[Among other things](../../use/help/index.md), Enola can _generate documentation_ about _Things,_ like this:

```bash cd .././.././..
$ ./enola docgen --load "file:docs/models/example.org/greeting1.ttl" --output=file:///tmp/models/ --no-index
...
```

[`greeting1.md`](greeting1.md) now contains:

```markdown
{% include-markdown "./greeting1.md" start="# `ex:greeting1`" end="---" comments=false %}
```

Note how the greeting, in addition to our `message` from above, automagically got another _property_ named `origin` - click on it to learn what it's for! Here is how this Markdown renders:

{% include-markdown "./greeting1.md" start="# `ex:greeting1`" end="---" comments=false %}
