# Classy

You can tell that the `greeting1` and `greeting2` from the previous steps are both some kind of _"Salutations",_ can't you? But Enola cannot.

[`greeting3.ttl`](greeting3.ttl) illustrates how you can make more _"classy"_ greetings:

```turtle
{% include "./greeting3.ttl" %}
```

This simply expresses that `greeting3` _"is a"_ `Salutation`. We're also adding an Emoji to the _Class,_ which Enola always displays for both that class itself and its instances. You can generate documentation:

```bash cd ../../..
$ ./enola docgen --load "file:docs/models/example.org/greeting3.ttl" --output=file:///tmp/models/ --no-index
...
```

{% include-markdown "./Salutation.md" end="---" comments=false %}

and:

{% include-markdown "./greeting3.md" end="---" comments=false %}

PS: RDF also has (various) ways of expressing "constraints" (AKA "shapes") of _Things,_ based on such _Classes_ (and similar concepts). Enola itself does not directly support e.g. validations of such a _"types"_ (yet) - but you could use other RDF existing tooling!
