# Graphs

Enola can [visualize graphs](../../concepts/graph.md) of Things in _"network"_ diagrams with [Rosetta](../../use/rosetta/index.md#graphviz) and [DocGen](../../use/docgen/index.md).

## Graphviz

```bash cd ../../..
$ ./enola rosetta --in docs/models/example.org/greeting3.ttl --out=docs/BUILT/greetings3.gv && dot -Tsvg -O docs/BUILT/greetings3.gv
...
```

produces this:

![Tutorial Graph](../../BUILT/greetings3.gv.svg)

## Styles

The <https://enola.dev/color> and <https://enola.dev/text-color> predicates can be used to style graphs.
