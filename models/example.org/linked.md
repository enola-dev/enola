# Linked Data

Now check out the [`greeting2.ttl`](greeting2.ttl):

```turtle
{% include "./greeting2.ttl" %}
```

Let's generate documentation:

```bash cd .././.././..
$ ./enola docgen --load "file:docs/models/example.org/greeting2.ttl" --output=file://"$PWD"/docs/models/ --no-index
...
```

[`greeting2.md`](greeting2.md) now contains:

```markdown
{% include-markdown "./greeting2.md" start="# greeting2" end="---" comments=false %}
```

There are a couple of things worth noting here:

1. We've introduced the `@prefix` shortcut, just to avoid repeating `https://example.org`.
1. Instead of a `hello, world` string, we're now greeting an _Object,_ the `https://example.org/world` - this is what _Linked Data_ is all about!
1. That `world` object contains yet another link, but this one is different... can you tell how & why, by clicking on `world` in the rendered Markdown below?

{% include-markdown "./greeting2.md" start="# greeting2" end="---" comments=false %}
