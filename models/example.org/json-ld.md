# JSON-LD

Are you tired of using üê¢ Turtles to write models? You are more familiar with JSON and YAML!

[JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) is a W3C standard to map JSON (and therefore YAML) to the RDF linked data model.

## YAML

We can rewrite the [`greeting2.ttl`](greeting2.ttl) from the [Linked Data](linked.md) chapter as this [`greeting2.yaml`](greeting2.yaml):

```yaml
{% include "./greeting2.yaml" start="# limitations under the License.\n" %}
```

Of course, we lost what uniquely identified our things... but JSON-LD Contexts can re-provide that, using this [`greeting-context.jsonld`](greeting-context.jsonld): <!-- TODO Write greeting-context.jsonld as greeting-context.yamlld ... -->

```json
{% include "./greeting-context.jsonld" %}
```

Combining these, Enola can recreate the same data model, and generating documentation will look the same as in the original [Linked Data](linked.md) chapter, using this:

```bash cd .././.././..
$ ./enola docgen --load="models/example.org/greeting2.yaml?context=models/example.org/greeting-context.jsonld" --output=/tmp/models/ --no-index
...
```

[Tools > JSON-LD](../../use/json-ld/index.md) has more reference documentation about JSON-LD in Enola.
