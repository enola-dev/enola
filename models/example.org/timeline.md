# Timeline

Enola can visualize Things on “timeline” diagrams with <!-- TODO [Rosetta](../../use/rosetta/index.md#graphviz) and --> [DocGen](../../use/docgen/index.md).

<!-- Write a short but illustrative example TTL, with both start & end, only timestamp, and neither; and link, after integrating https://github.com/javdome/timeline-arrows -->

[Here](../../concepts/timeline.md) is an example.
