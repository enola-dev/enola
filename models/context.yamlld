# TODO Enola must convert this to JSON...
# TODO ID must include a version in some way...
"@id": https://enola.dev/context.jsonld # TODO .jsonld or .yamlld, here?!
"@context":
  # This allows to use $prefix etc. instead of "@prefix".
  # This is convenient in YAML, and 'safer' than just "prefix";
  # and it matches the https://json-schema.org convention.

# PS: There is intentionally no "@vocab" : https://enola.dev/ here, as we want to default to that.
