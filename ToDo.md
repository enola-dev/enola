# Enola üïµüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ToDo

## High Priority (Next Features)

1. Write Web UI MVP (now that Soy templates work)

1. Support top-level `ns: "demo"` in `docs/use/library/model.textproto` and rm others

1. Write `docs/use/rosetta`

1. Convert Library demo model from TextProto to YAML using `enola rosetta`, and include that YAML on `docs/use/library` MD

1. Write a `FilestoreRepositoryAspect` demo+doc for library

1. `connectors/demo/` with test to illustrate the Service to get IDs

1. Publish Site

1. Create Tutorial Slides!
   - Write using https://github.com/maaslalani/slides
   - Record ^^^ them for docs/use/intro/*.gif using https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs/tree/main/examples/slides
   - Or use https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme
   - Or (and?!) use a HTML, not TUI + GIF, one like:
     - https://sli.dev
     - https://revealjs.com
     - https://marp.app
     - https://gist.github.com/johnloy/27dd124ad40e210e91c70dd1c24ac8c8

1. UI Enhancements
   - Search should be more in the middle
   - Icon should be vertically aligned in the middle
   - Footer

1. Put MVP (!) screenshot image on README (and make README very short; like e.g. https://github.com/jorisroovers/gitlint)
   See https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/images/
   With https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/grids/

---

## Low Priority / Nice To Have

1. Icon based on some Status `data` from Connector; e.g. üìó / üìò / üìô / üìï

1. https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-site-analytics/

1. LinuxMachine MVP; incl. dmsg Kernel Log analyzer, https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter reader, etc.

1. Fix mediaType from extension so that e.g. this will work:

       ./enola -v --model=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enola-dev/enola/main/core/impl/src/test/resources/demo-model.textproto docgen

1. Add support for writing and reading `ProtobufMediaTypes.PROTOBUF_YAML_UTF_8` - easy, given that _YAML is JSON?_

1. https://github.com/enola-dev/enola/issues/102 :
   Enforce https://www.conventionalcommits.org like git commit messages
   starting with feat/model/fix/build/docs/clean/format/refactor: and core/k8s/tools:
   using https://github.com/jorisroovers/gitlint

1. Replace `shellcheck` with a pre-commit check instead of running it in Bazel

1. CLI completion - hard or trivial?

1. Move `common/common/src/[main|test]**/protobuf` to `common/protobuf` (requires ServiceLoader in `MediaTypeDetector`)

1. https://github.com/google/flogger/tree/master/grpc/src/main/java/com/google/common/flogger/grpc ?

1. Upstream `CommandLineSubject` to Picocli?

1. unifiedjs.com ?

1. Add to https://github.com/SquadcastHub/awesome-sre-tools

1. https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10456-prettier ? Or no longer needed, with VSC?
1. [Bazel Java IDE support](https://github.com/vorburger/LearningBazel/blob/develop/ToDo.md) in VSC instead IJ?!
1. [`google-java-format`](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) with VSC:

    - https://www.sethvargo.com/using-google-java-format-with-vs-code/
    - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=google-java-format&target=VSCode&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Relevance

1. docs: Make `tools/docs/serve.bash` use [`ibazel`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-watcher) to rebuild Proto MD on change of `.proto`

1. Eventually switch from Java 11 to probably Java 19 (in `.bazelrc`)

1. https://github.com/textlint/textlint with https://github.com/textlint/textlint/wiki/Collection-of-textlint-rule

1. `dev.enola.common.io.mediatype` adapter for https://tika.apache.org/2.7.0/api/org/apache/tika/detect/Detector.html

1. [Run `mkdocs build` instead of in `build.bash` as a `sh_test` in Bazel with `docs/**` + `mkdocs.yaml` as (only) `srcs`](https://github.com/enola-dev/enola/compare/main...vorburger:enola:mkdocs_build_test) - fix weird problems

1. Proto design: Is this a real requirement, or can we forget about this: _"Note that IDs are not "unique", and 2
   different IDs may refer to the same underlying object; for example: `k8s:pod?name=echoserver-6dfb6c7764-45gvk&...`
   and `k8s:pod?uid=561f1bec-f768-4c5b-b96e-37306d7f2f8a&...`"_

1. Proto design: Should `EntityKind` have a _"param_parent, to allow grouping common ones, just during declaration in
   textproto, but inlined for use."_ or shall we forget about that?

1. Proto design: Should we permit RPC clients to _"specify the ID in either (oneof)string text or "broken down" parts
   form. This is simply for dev convenience in UX such as CLI or Web UIs, and to avoid the proliferation of incompatible
   parsers. The implementation validates the text, and rejects e.g. "demo:foo?bad=a=b" or "demo:foo?bad=a&bad=b". The
   string text oneof form is NOT "decoded" like un-escaped (incl. un-quoted) at all, simply "split" ... ? There
   was `IDsTest.java` and `IDs.java` code related to this which I removed on 2023-03-19:_

       message ID {
           oneof oneof {
               string text = 1;
               Parts parts = 2;
           }
           message Parts {
               string scheme = 1;
               string entity_kind = 2;
               repeated string segments = 3;
           }
       }
