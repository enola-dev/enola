# Enola üïµüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ToDo

1. Enforce https://www.conventionalcommits.org like git commit messages
   starting with feat/model/fix/build/docs/clean/format/refactor: and core/k8s/tools:
   using https://github.com/jorisroovers/gitlint

1. Replace `shellcheck` with a pre-commit check instead of running it in Bazel

1. Implement QueryAvailableEntities, based on the model
1. connectors/demo/ with test to illustrate the Service to get IDs
1. CLI with PicoCLI for `enola-demo be OK foo:a`
1. CLI completion - hard or trivial?

1. Move `common/common/src/[main|test]**/protobuf` to `common/protobuf` (requires ServiceLoader in `MediaTypeDetector`)

1. Add support for writing and reading `ProtobufMediaTypes.PROTOBUF_YAML_UTF_8` - easy, given that _YAML is JSON?_

1. K8s MVP Proto

    - `ownerReferences`

1. Read [RFC 6570](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6570) and integrate https://github.com/fge/uri-template for QueryParameter#ref_id_template

1. Put MVP (!) screenshot image on README (and make README very short; like e.g. https://github.com/jorisroovers/gitlint)
   See https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/images/
   With https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/grids/

1. Publish Site
1. https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-site-analytics/

1. https://github.com/google/flogger/tree/master/grpc/src/main/java/com/google/common/flogger/grpc ?

1. Use GitHub Projects & Roadmap to create The Plan, and use Trello-like Kanban board view with ToDo, WIP, Done.

1. https://unifiedjs.com ?

1. LinuxMachine MVP; incl. dmsg Kernel Log analyzer, https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter reader, etc.

1. Add to https://github.com/SquadcastHub/awesome-sre-tools

1. https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10456-prettier ? Or no longer needed, with VSC?
1. [Bazel Java IDE support](https://github.com/vorburger/LearningBazel/blob/develop/ToDo.md) in VSC instead IJ?!
1. [`google-java-format`](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) with VSC:

    - https://www.sethvargo.com/using-google-java-format-with-vs-code/
    - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=google-java-format&target=VSCode&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Relevance

1. docs: Make `tools/docs/serve.bash` use [`ibazel`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-watcher) to rebuild Proto MD on change of `.proto`

1. Eventually switch from Java 11 to probably Java 19 (in `.bazelrc`)

1. https://github.com/textlint/textlint with https://github.com/textlint/textlint/wiki/Collection-of-textlint-rule

1. `dev.enola.common.io.mediatype` adapter for https://tika.apache.org/2.7.0/api/org/apache/tika/detect/Detector.html

1. [Run `mkdocs build` instead of in `build.bash` as a `sh_test` in Bazel with `docs/**` + `mkdocs.yaml` as (only) `srcs`](https://github.com/enola-dev/enola/compare/main...vorburger:enola:mkdocs_build_test) - fix weird problems
