# Enola üïµüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ToDo

1. Bazel and/or Gradle?
   - Bazel with VSC with Red Hat's Java extension seems a PITA, due to https://github.com/bazelbuild/vscode-bazel/issues/281.
   - https://github.com/georgewfraser/java-language-server looks promising, but https://github.com/georgewfraser/java-language-server/issues?q=author%3Avorburger+
   - https://github.com/salesforce/bazel-eclipse/issues/450 blocks Eclipse instead of VSC
   - Bazel and Gradle is PITA to keep in-sync? Maybe simplest, for now?
