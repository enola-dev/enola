# Enola üïµüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ToDo

1. Enforce https://www.conventionalcommits.org like git commit messages
   starting with feat/model/fix/build/docs/clean/format/refactor: and core/k8s/tools:
   using https://github.com/jorisroovers/gitlint

1. https://github.com/tcort/markdown-link-check/ via pre-commit as shown e.g. on https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/issues/2687
   (And contribute a PR to the project to illustrate how to use it on the README.)

1. Replace `shellcheck` with a pre-commit check instead of running it in Bazel
1. Abandon `build.bash` by running script as a `sh_test` in Bazel with `docs/**` + `mkdocs.yaml` as (only) `srcs`
1. docs: `serve.bash` with `mkdocs server` AND Bazel "watch" (?) to rebuild Proto MD on change of `.proto`

1. Implement QueryAvailableEntities, based on the model
1. connectors/demo/ with test to illustrate the Service to get IDs
1. CLI with PicoCLI for `enola-demo be OK foo:a`
1. CLI completion - hard or trivial?

1. K8s MVP Proto

    - `ownerReferences`

1. Read [RFC 6570](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6570) and integrate https://github.com/fge/uri-template for QueryParameter#ref_id_template

1. Put MVP (!) screenshot image on README (and make README very short; like e.g. https://github.com/jorisroovers/gitlint's)
   See https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/images/
   With https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/grids/

1. Use GitHub Projects & Roadmap to create The Plan, and use Trello-like Kanban board view with ToDo, WIP, Done.

1. https://unifiedjs.com ?

1. LinuxMachine MVP; incl. dmsg Kernel Log analyzer, https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter reader, etc.

1. https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-site-analytics/

1. Add to https://github.com/SquadcastHub/awesome-sre-tools

1. https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10456-prettier ? Or no longer needed, with VSC?
1. [Bazel Java IDE support](https://github.com/vorburger/LearningBazel/blob/develop/ToDo.md) in VSC instead IJ?!
1. [`google-java-format`](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) with VSC:

    - https://www.sethvargo.com/using-google-java-format-with-vs-code/
    - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=google-java-format&target=VSCode&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Relevance

1. [Dependabot](https://github.com//dependabot-core/issues/2196), or Renovate

1. Eventually switch from Java 11 to probably Java 19 (in `.bazelrc`)

1. https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/dev-intellij.html#_copyright ?

1. https://github.com/textlint/textlint with https://github.com/textlint/textlint/wiki/Collection-of-textlint-rule
