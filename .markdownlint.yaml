# Beware, there are several project, and GitHub repos, named something like Markdown Lint.
# This project uses https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint, via .pre-commit-config.yaml
# (as well as the DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint in .vscode/settings.json, or other IDEs;
# TODO figure out how configure IntelliJ for markdownlint...
# but https://github.com/Strajk/intellij-plugin-markdownlint does not look great).

# The following are OTHER confusingly similarly named tools, which this project does NOT use:

#   - https://github.com/updownpress/markdown-lint

  # mkdocs (Material) apparently works with "standard" (common?) 2 indent in some cases, but not others
  # (the exact rule when it works and when it does not is not clear, to me; but never mind). However, it
  # always formats nested unordered lists correctly when using 4 indents - so we enforce that.

  # Must match .editorconfig [*.md] max_line_length
  # This 4096 means "unlimited" (unset) - essentially https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/issues/298.
  # Until https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/issues/535 is available,
  # it's not feasible to set this - just too PITA, while writing docs.
  #
  # One possible avenue to enable fixing automatic reflow formatting could be
  # to enable Prettier to format MD (by removing *.md from .prettierignore).
  # This ALMOST works, but in Prettier v2.8.4 just has some issues:
  #   A. Breaks code blocks inside 1. 1. 1. OL; see https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/13175
  #   B. Replaces '*' with '-' for UL; not my preference, but is likely intentional,
  #      given https://prettier.io/docs/en/option-philosophy.html.
  #   C. It over-indents '-' causing MD030; see https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/5299
  #      and https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/5306 or https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/13987 ?
  # Another avenue would be to look into a different MD formatter than Prettier,
  # perhaps remark directly ... but that seems a bit overkill, for now.
