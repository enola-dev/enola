  # One possible avenue to enable fixing automatic reflow formatting could be
  # to enable Prettier to format MD (by removing *.md from .prettierignore).
  # This ALMOST works, but in Prettier v2.8.4 just has some issues:
  #   A. Breaks code blocks inside 1. 1. 1. OL; see https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/13175
  #   B. Replaces '*' with '-' for UL; not my preference, but is likely intentional,
  #      given https://prettier.io/docs/en/option-philosophy.html.
  #   C. It over-indents '-' causing MD030; see https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/5299
  #      and https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/5306 or https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/13987 ?
  # Another avenue would be to look into a different MD formatter than Prettier,
  # perhaps remark directly ... but that seems a bit overkill, for now.
