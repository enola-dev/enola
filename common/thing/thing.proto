// Thing is (obviously) inspired by "Triples" (RDF), but also things such as

// schema.capnp](https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/blob/master/c%2B%2B/src/capnp/schema.capnp),

//
// It intentionally doesn't quite look like

// because RDF4j already has its own binary serialization format - the point of
// this is not to directly replicate that, but to permit integration of RDF4j
// into Protocol Buffer based ecosystems.
