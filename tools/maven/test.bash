# Note that the JBang version is not fixed, and could change. This is *normally* fine, as it's supposed to backwards compatible.
# In the past we used to "pin" it here (via "rm -rf ~/.jbang/ && JBANG_DOWNLOAD_VERSION=0.122.0 learn/jbang/jbang ...),
# due to https://github.com/enola-dev/enola/issues/1040, but since that's been resolved, we don't anymore now.)
