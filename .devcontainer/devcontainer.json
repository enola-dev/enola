    // DO NOT REMOVE Bazel! Unless you *really* know what you're doing! Like really.
    //
    // The reason is that, while the CLI build with ./test.bash and all will still work,
    // the Visual Studio Code Web on GitHub Codespaces will break without this - even
    // if you installed Bazel/Bazelisk in another script.
    //
    // The reason for that is that the Language Server from the VSC Bazel Java extension
    // needs to be able to launch "bazel" from PATH - and that only works if it's in a
    // directory that's on the OS default PATH, such as e.g. in /usr/local/bin/ - but
    // VSC (Web) WON'T WORK if bazelisk is in some place like ~/go/bin/ or wherever.
