# Enola `enola/web` TODO

## Tech

1. Fix CORS ?
1. Use https://bun.sh/docs/install/workspaces to have a `package.json` e.g. for the Prettier version at the root, and have the one in `web/package.json`

## Functional

* Try out https://graphology.github.io/standard-library/layout-noverlap
* Do coloring using https://graphology.github.io/standard-library/communities-louvain; see https://gemini.google.com/app/4e3c639fc5213673

* Exploratory Mode... like http://en.lodlive.it, with UX as follows: Hide edges, until Node is clicked.

* Switch from GEXF to ~~JSON~~ https://rdf.js.org
* Show Edge labels!
* Show fixed type colors (like Graphviz already does)

* Highlight when hovering over label as well, not just dot
* Hover over Nodes should highlight all its edges

* Merge with //java/dev/enola/web/resources/static/main.css and show green NavBar
* Click on node should open Enola details page on the right

* Dark Modus support! ;-)

## Technical

### Bazel

* Use https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js ... would have worked for `pnpm`, but won't for `bun`...
  but perhaps a simple GenRule, with some https://github.com/bazel-contrib/bazel-lib/blob/main/docs/write_source_files.md magic?
  Maybe quite simple, see https://gemini.google.com/app/9e87284a1100a011.

### Testing

* Web Test would be nice... at least just DOM, at first? Then, or directly, Browser?
    * Split Graphology & Sigma related code in x2 separate .ts; and test Graphology GEXF initial coordinates in Node, without Browser?
    * Try https://playwright.dev for web UI testing? With https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/chrome-for-testing?
* Make `bazel test //web` run web tests

### Performance

* Fix lack of "never cache" header support on GitHub pages by hosting the demo app elsewhere
    * https://gist.github.com/maximebories/961f12101af369804d40d5ec287e562b probably won't work?
    * E.g. Netlify or Cloudflare Pages, or maybe on IPFS with Pinata
    * https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/headers/

### Maintainability

* Include `VERSION` (with Git rev) into front-end, probably using https://bun.sh/docs/bundler#env ?
* Enable https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/6528, once that's released
* Recheck if https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/1760 got implemented, to avoid "seeing" transitive (only) dependencies in `import`
